[filters]

# Filters
#
# These settings define which filters are to be used while displaying a list of resources.
#
# E.g.: image_filters = ubuntu-16.04*, ubuntu-18.04*, ubuntu*, debian*, ami*, arch*, Fedora-Cloud*,
#
# Names are case-sensitive: fedora* and Fedora* expressions will return two different sets of images.
#
# If you want a full list of all the images available for AWS, set image_filters = *.
# Not really suggested: 117.000+ results will be returned. Don't say you haven't been warned.
#
# If no filters are applied and free tier isn't enabled, no images will be listed.
#
# For more details about filtering in Amazon Web Services, please visit
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Filtering.html,
# section "Listing and Filtering Using the CLI and API"
