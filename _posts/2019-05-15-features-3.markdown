An integrated Monitor and Rule Engine allows to keep an eye on all of your instances and issue commands
if certain requirements are met (e.g. clone the instance if its CPU usage was over 80% during the last 5 minutes).<br/>
In this way, the user can create policies and mechanisms to prevent faults and to provide service scalability.
